Shopping List App
===========

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93347177/158183209-ef682fb2-260c-4547-95c5-c94ccd238688.PNG" width="500px"><br/>

This was the first app that I ever created, and after I had only been coding for six weeks in total.

It is a simple microservices infrastructure app built with vanilla HTML and JavaScript.

It allows users to add items to the shopping list, view the shopping list, and delete the shopping list.

The front-end HTML page sends information to local host 3000 â€“ and this information is intercepted by the server at the same address. The information is then saved in an array.
